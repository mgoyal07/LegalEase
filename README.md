# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The project is a search for the solution to the problems of creating a text summarization 
system for the law ones that not only gives a shortened version of a legal document, but 
also allows users to ask questions in natural language. With simultaneously presenting 
legal materials to the people in the accessive and interactive way the system pushes on the 
gap between legal professionals and the general public, hence enhancing people’s 
awareness of and work with legal texts.
# OBJECTIVES
The vast amount of legal documents can be overwhelming for anyone who needs to 
understand their content. This Project proposes a system that combines following
techniques:
 Legal Document Summarization: Generate concise summaries capturing the
essential legal points.
 Question Answering: Answer user queries directly within the context of the 
document.
 Ensure that simplified legal texts are easily understandable for a wide range of 
users, including legal professionals, laypersons, and individuals with varying levels
of literacy.
 Develop user-friendly interfaces that facilitate intuitive interaction.
 Provide tools and resources that assist researchers in navigating and synthesizing
legal information effectively, enhancing productivity in legal research tasks
